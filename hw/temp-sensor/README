These programs read a temperature sensor from a raspberry pi.

This is specifically designed to read a TMP36 thermistor connected to an
MCP3008 A/D converter. More details are in the .py files.

Apart from just reading the temperature, a lot of what's in here focuses on
exposing that data in an easy-to-consume way (the collector runs as a daemon,
there are initscripts, and there are separate plugins for various monitoring
frameworks)
