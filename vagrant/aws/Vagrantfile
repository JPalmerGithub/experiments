# This creates and configures a Digital Ocean VM suitable for interactive use.
# It pulls my public configs from github. It would be suitable as a throwaway
# development machine, or something like that.
#
# This config sets up a particular EC2 VM. Things like your amazon credentials,
# and the credentials to access the VM, are kept in a 'localonly.yaml' file.
#
# Instructions:
#   vagrant plugin install vagrant-aws
#   wget https://github.com/mitchellh/vagrant-aws/raw/master/dummy.box
#   vagrant box add dummy dummy.box
#   
#   Then fill out a 'localonly.yaml' with the fields referenced in this file.
#   It should look something like the following. The fields are hopefully
#   self-explanatory:
#
#   auth:
#     access_key_id: foo
#     secret_access_key: bar
#     private_key_path: ~/.ssh/aws-key
#     keypair_name: aws-key
#   machine:
#     security_groups: sg-123
#     subnet_id: subnet-123
