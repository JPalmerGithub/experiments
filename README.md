experiments
===========

Experiments that are too small or short-lived to put in their own repositories.
If I go further with any of this code, I'll split it off into its own repository.

Documentation is very sparse, but my goal is for everything to be in a working state when 
it is committed. Some sub-directories have their own README files with more info.
